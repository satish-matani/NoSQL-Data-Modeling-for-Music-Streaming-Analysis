# NoSQL-Data-Modeling-for-Music-Streaming-Analysis

Developed a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra to optimize data analysis for a music streaming app. The project involved modeling and querying user activity data to provide insights into song preferences and listening habits. Key tasks included setting up a Cassandra cluster, creating keyspaces and tables, and executing queries to extract meaningful patterns from the dataset. This solution effectively replaced the previous CSV-based storage system, enhancing data accessibility and query performance.
